      <h2>The Unseen Wizard: A Beginner's Guide to JavaScript</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is the programming language that makes websites cool. It
        adds animations, shows interactive elements, and can even remember our
        preferences when browsing the web . JS is the secret ingredient that
        brings websites to life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Imagine you’re building a house:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> This is like the
          plans – it defines the structure of the building, like walls, doors,
          and windows. On a website these would be known as the elements.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> This is the decorator.
          The artist of the pack. It adds the style – paint colors, furniture,
          and even that sweet retro lamp you scored from Grandma. Similarly, on
          a website, CSS does all the styling and arrangement within the
          structure.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>JavaScript:</strong> What we need to do is picture a magical
          but unseen wizard that lives in your house. It can control things,
          make things happen, and add a touch of magic. It can change the
          colours on the website (like dimming the lights), manifest messages
          (like a hidden room), or even remember your favourite settings (like
          the perfect temperature on your heat pump).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        But how does this wizard cast his spells? Here's a sneak peek into his
        bag of tricks:
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
      <p>
        Think of the DOM as a map of your website. Every element, from text to
        images to buttons, has a specific place on this map. Web browsers have
        built-in tools (like Chrome developer tools) that let you see and
        interact with this map. It’s like a crystal ball that can be used to
        view what is going on in a website at any time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are like little spells the wizard uses to perform specific
        tasks. Let's say you want the website to display the message "Alacazam"
        whenever you hover over a button. JS can create a function that takes
        care of this with this code:
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="/images/fucntion.PNG" class="code-img" />
      <br />

      <p>
        In this example, doMagic is the function name. When you call this
        function by hovering over the button on the website, it will display the
        message (and hopefully you don’t turn into a frog!).
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are like the wizard's shaft and a place where he can roll out his
        spells. Spells can only be added or removed from one end which means the
        wizard needs to be mindful of the order he stores his spells. A
        practical, at-home example, might be a (rather narrow) cleaning
        cupboard. This code shows a cleaningCupboard array with each item stored
        in a specific order.
      </p>

      <br />
      <img src="/images/array.PNG" class="code-img" />
      <br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        Objects are the wizard's well-organised magic chest, with compartments
        for categorised items. Each compartment is labeled with a key, and the
        item inside is the value. Sticking with our house example, a dirty
        bathroom needing to be cleaned could be an object with tasks as
        key-value pairs:
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="/images/object.PNG" class="code-img" />
      <br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        These are the wizard's decision-making tools. Imagine having a set
        number of cleaning chores. Loops allow JS to repeat a set of
        instructions for a certain number of times, making sure everything gets
        done, and control flow is what allows JS to make decisions and repeat
        tasks based on those decisions. This ensures everything gets done, and
        in the right order. Here's a simple example using an if statement (a
        decision) and a for loop (repetition):
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="/images/loop.PNG" class="code-img" />
      <br />
      <p>
        This code loops through the cleanBathroom array four times and displays
        a different message based on each task.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        This is just a glimpse into the other-worldly powers of JavaScript. It's
        a special tool that makes websites interactive and user-friendly.
