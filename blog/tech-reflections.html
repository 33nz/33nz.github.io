        <h3 class="blog-h3">Command Line</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          There is quite a bit to remember and I get stuck wasting time on
          little things that I want to learn how to do but can't clearly find
          the answer. An example of this would be trying how to figure out how
          to open a file form the command line (i.e. this reflections journal)
          and I got stuck. It's important form me to move away from my need to
          try and undersdantn everyting otherwise I will waste time fretting
          about the small stuff. It's better to stick to the learning philosophy
          of "just in time" as opposed the "just in case" that I seem to
          gravitate too.
          <br />I would describe the Command Line as the bridge. Like how a ship
          on the ocean has a bridge where the captain sits to act a central
          point or hub to control the functions and operations of the vessel
          (i.e. the engine and electrical rooms of ship).

            directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            mkdir: stands for make directory and creates a file or folder.
          </li>

          <li>
            pwd: stands for print working directory and shows where you are in
            the terminal.

          <li>
            rm(file) / rm -r(directory): stands for remove and deletes things

          </li>
        </ol>

          I don't think I learnt anything unexpected here - this is all so new
          to me so everything is unexpected (and exciting). Actually some cool
          things I am picking up on is the general navigation of the computer by
          using the keyboard only. Tab and the windows key is great for
          navigating apps and controly and it is helpful for creating a new
          browswer tab in brave. Also I have found control/S to save work
          helpful.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Git and Github</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          The differnce between GIT and GITHUB is that GIT is a software (short
          for global information tracker) and GITHUB is a service that is built
          on GIT. An analogy to describe them is that GIT is electircity and
          that GITHUB is the heater that uses the electircity to warm a home.
          Another analogy would be that GIT is Gold and that GITHUB could be
          viewed as piece of jewllery. GIT is the form and GITHUB is a
          utilisation of that form.
          <em
            >I think that I would remember the difference a week from now,
            particularly if I can remember that GIT stands for Global
            Information Tracker and is a software.</em
          >
          I did not stick to the timebox suggestions as I felt that there was so
          much more I could have leart by spending more time in the learning and
          less time reflecting. This was because I took some notes that I could
          refer back to later. I did better than I would usually do (having a
          tendency to go down rabbit-holes) as I did stick to the overall time
          allocation for this section.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Version Control with Git</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          Git workflow is the process of creating, cloning, editing and
          submitting files and directories withing the GIT software. It works by
          using the termnial to do the and the commiting the work or changes to
          GIThub for the storage and accessibility for others. To be honest
          there was a lot of information to take in with this lesson and my
          brain is feeling well exercised. I was confused when there was the
          request to create an html file and I wasn't sure where or how to do
          this, althouts I stuck to the 20 minutes of trying to figure it out
          rule and got there in the end. I quite enjoy these processes and the
          small snippents of satisfaction when things works as they are meant
          to. Because of this I maybe took longer than I should have as I re-did
          some things and just practiced the some of the processes (like
          changing file names and moving files etc) for reps and familirisation.
          I just downloaded a cheat sheet for all of the commands as there was
          quite a few to recall. I'm not sure if I would do much differently if
          I had to do this again.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Stage and Commit</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          If I was to describe what stage and commit was to my non-tech-savy
          friend, I would tell them that the stage (or index) in the analogy of
          a production factory has the stage being the despatch area when some
          goods are ready to be sent to a customer, and that the commit is the
          courier collecting the goods (i.e. when the leave the factory) and are
          now billable.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Branch, Pull and Merger</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          The main is the main trunk of a git repo - it is the most prisitine
          and safe version that other versions (branches) are to be created
          from. We create branches as it is important to have a safe space to
          build new things (and make errors along the way) that doesn't cause
          problems to the most up to date and prisitnie version (being the
          Main). <br />
          <br /><em
            >These concepts do feel intuitive as they are just common sense. The
            fact that I can visualise the concpet by imaginging the structure of
            a tree and that the terminology is associated with the tree also
            makes in extra common sense. It's a practical and logical
            concept.</em

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Github Clone and Fork</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          We would fork when we are wanting to develop a project that furthers
          on from the code of another <em>open-source</em> repository. This
          means that we have our own snaphot version of the code to develop
          without hgaving to worry about the repercusions in making errors to
          the original. Forking also means that we can debug problems without
          needing certain levels of permissions within the source repo.
          <br /><br />
          I felt that things clicked easier for me with the
          <em>forking</em> part of the lesson. For me it feels more seemless to
          have a copied version that is completely separate compared to the
          <em>branches and mergers</em> of the previous lesson.
