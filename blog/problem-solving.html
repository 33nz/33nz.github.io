      <h2>Problem-Solving Adventures at Dev Academy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experiences with problem-solving at
        Dev Academy so far. It's been very (very) challenging, but I'm
        definitely getting better at tackling those coding puzzles.
      </p>
      <h3>Breaking Down Problems with Pseudocode</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        One strategy that's been really helpful is using pseudocode. It's
        basically writing a simplified version of the code in plain English.
        This lets me break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable
        steps. Seeing the code alongside these explanations really helps
        solidify those new JavaScript concepts in my mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Giving It a Crack Before Diving In</h3>
      <p>
        Before I jump into pseudocode, I usually try to tackle the problem
        myself first, even if I don't get very far. It's important to give it a
        shot because the more I practice, the better my intuition will become.
        Plus, it gets me in the habit of trying things out on my own first,
        which is a valuable skill to have as a developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Power in Quacking It Out</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes, just talking about the problem can be surprisingly helpful.
        I've actually had a few instances where I've started explaining my issue
        in the Discord group, and in the process of talking it out, I've figured
        out the solution myself. Maybe it's because verbalizing the problem
        helps me see it from a different angle, or maybe it's just a coincidence
        – either way, it works!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Googling Struggle</h3>
      <p>
        Alright, let's talk about Googling. While it's an amazing resource, it
        can also be a bit of a minefield. There's just so much information out
        there, and sometimes it's hard to find the specific answer you're
        looking for. Plus, if you don't word your question perfectly, you can
        end up down a rabbit hole of irrelevant solutions, leaving you more
        confused than before!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Importance of Asking for Help</h3>
      <p>
        While I don't always love asking for help, I've learned it's crucial. A
        huge thank you to Andrew and Joel for being so patient and helpful
        whenever I've reached out to them. The same goes for Shrena and the
        facilitators in the Discord tech-help channel. Here's the thing: I used
        to worry about looking bad if I asked too many questions. But I'm
        realizing that asking for help is a sign of a growth mindset, not a
        fixed one. In fact, everyone needs help sometimes!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Learning from Errors (Console Edition)</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best things about coding is how informative error messages
        can be, especially those from console.log. It's like having a
        line-by-line snitch telling you exactly where your code went wrong – a
        lifesaver when you're debugging!<br />
        Speaking of console.log, it took me a while to grasp its power. Think of
        it as a secret conversation with your code, where you can ask questions
        and see what's happening behind the scenes. This is incredibly helpful
        for figuring out if your code is working as intended.<br />
        Let me share a recent example. I was working on a function called
        concatMyArray that aimed to join the elements of an array into a single
        string. I was using the .join method, but to my surprise, the output had
        commas separating each word.<br />
        Here's where console.log came in handy. By strategically placing these
        statements throughout my code, I could inspect the state of the array at
        different points. Examining the output, I saw that .join was working,
        but adding commas by default.<br />
        A quick Google search with "remove commas join method JavaScript" led me
        to the solution. It turns out, .join allows you to specify a separator
        character. By calling .join('') with an empty string as the separator, I
        could effectively remove the commas and achieve the desired outcome.
        This small fix made a big difference, all thanks to the power of
        console.log and a little online sleuthing.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflecting on the Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Taking time for self-reflection has been a real game-changer. Keeping a
        daily journal and doing sprint reflections helps me track my progress
        and solidify what I'm learning. The more I reflect, the better equipped
        I am to tackle future coding challenges.<br />
        So yeah, that's my problem-solving journey so far! It's definitely been
        a challenge, but with a mix of these techniques and a willingness to
        learn, I'm feeling more confident each day.
