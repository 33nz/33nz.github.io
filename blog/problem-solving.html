      <h2>Problem-Solving Missions at Dev Academy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kia Ora, this post is about sharing my experiences with problem-solving
        at Dev Academy so far. The course has been very (very) challenging, but
        I'm definitely understanding more each day that goes by.

      <h3>Breaking Down Problems with Pseudocode</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        One strategy that's been really helpful is using pseudocode. It's
        basically writing a simplified version of the code in plain English.
        This lets me break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable
        steps. Seeing the code alongside these explanations really helps
        solidify those new JavaScript concepts in my mind.

      <h3>Giving It a Crack Before Diving In</h3>
      <p>
        Before I jump into pseudocode, I usually try to tackle the problem
        myself first, even if I don't get very far. It's important to give it a
        shot because the more I practice, the better my intuition will become.
        Plus, it gets me in the habit of trying things out on my own first,
        which I feel will be a valuable skill to have as a (free-thinking)
        developer.

      <h3>The Power in Quacking It Out</h3>

          target="_blank"
          >Rubber Duck Method</a
        >
        is a powerful tool for coders. Sometimes, just talking about the problem
        can be surprisingly helpful. I've had a few instances where I've started
        explaining my issue in the Discord group (i.e., the discord ducky), and
        in the process of writing it out, another angle for the solution has
        come to me. Maybe it's because verbalising the problem helps me see it
        in a different way, or maybe it's just a coincidence.

      <h3>The Googling Struggle</h3>
      <p>
        While Google is an amazing resource, it can also be a bit of a
        minefield. There's just so much information out there, and sometimes
        it's hard to find the specific answer you're looking for. I've found
        that when I Google to solve problems, that if I don't word my questions
        perfectly, I can end up down time-wasting rabbit-holes of irrelevant
        information, leaving me more confused than before!

      <h3>The Importance of Asking for Help</h3>
      <p>
        While I don't always love asking for help, I've learned it's important
        for me to be doing so. My peers have been super-supportive and helpful
        whenever I've reached out to them (a huge shout out to Andrew and Joel).
        The same goes for Shrena and the facilitators in the Discord tech-help
        channel. Being honest, I have worried about coming across as stupid if I
        ask too many questions in Discord. But I'm realising through the core
        teachings of the course, that asking for help is a sign of a growth
        mindset, not a fixed one, and as a matter of fact - everyone needs help
        sometimes!

      <h3>Learning from Errors and console.log</h3>
      <p>
        One of the great things in coding is how informative error messages can
        be, especially from the console.log. It's like having a personal
        'know-it-all', who's very black and white, telling me exactly where the
        code went wrong.<br /><br />
        It took me a while to grasp its power, and how to utilise it, but feel I
        have started figure it out. I was working on a function called
        concatMyArray that aimed to join the elements of an array into a single
        string. I was using the .join() method, but the output had commas
        separating each word.<br /><br />
        Running the code through the console.log, I could inspect the state of
        the array. Examining the output, I saw that .join() was working, but
        adding commas by default.<br /><br />
        A quick Google search with "remove commas from join method JavaScript"
        had me (for once) find the solution. It turns out, .join() specifies a
        separator character with a comma by default. By calling .join('') with
        an empty string as the separator, I could effectively remove the commas
        and pass the problem of the test. This small fix made a big difference,
        all thanks to the power of console.log and a little online sleuthing.

      <h3>Reflecting on the Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Taking time for self-reflection has been wonderfully helpful to me.
        Keeping a daily journal of my goals, challenges, successes, learnings,
        and doing sprint reflections helps me track my progress and solidify
        what I'm learning. I'm sure the more I reflect, the better equipped I
        will be to tackle future coding challenges. I hand write my daily
        journal reflections as I think it's important to not become too attached
        to working in a solely
        <em>digital</em> way.<br />

        So... that's my problem-solving journey so far. This whole course has
        definitely been a challenge, but with a mix of these techniques and a
        willingness to learn, I'm feeling more confident each day.
