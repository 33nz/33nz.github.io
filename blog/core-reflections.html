          >
          I really enjoyed this activity as it was the first time I felt like I
          was creating a real and live website. I am used the the dark and
          "unknowing" world of sales, where it's not always evident how
          <em>efforts</em> are progressing into value, and this work seems to be
          the opposite with tangible and real-time results being on-hand at the
          successful completion of steps and lessons.

            was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process
            differ from your preconceptions?</strong
          >
          I think this does feel like a fairly logical way of how a websit is
          made. I know a little bit about DNS and HTML and it seems logical that
          we need to connect the place (DNS) with the content (HTML) so a
          webpage and it's contents can be found, viewed (and hopefully)
          enjoyed.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">Thinking like a programmer</h3>
        <p class="blog-p">
          <strong>What is your process so far for solving problems?</strong>
          I feel that I generally have a good process for solving promblems. I
          tend to have the ability to first look at the problem in its entirety,
          then be able to step-back and break it down into smaller piexes to be
          looked at separtely. I also feel that I have a pretty good process of
          elimination way of trying to find solutions when I just cannot
          <em>intellectualise</em> the right answer. I appreciate this is not
          always the best way forward, but as long as the step can be reversed
          if it's not the correct path then I am comfortable to use this style
          of problem solving, and I do find I learn a lot and understand more in
          <em><strong>seeing what does not work too</strong></em
          >. It is possible to link this way of problem solving with the process
          of the <em>scientific method</em>.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong
            >Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a
            programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?</strong
          >
          Being able to break down (or decomposite) the problem into smaller
          parts is one of the universal themes that has come through. What great
          programmers can do really well is methodically break down a big
          problem into its requisite parts. Before they launch into a new
          problem or project they will look at all the individual tasks to
          achieve first as the development of either part may be influenced by
          the form or functionality of another part. For example the UI (e.g.,
          placement of buttons) will be dictated by the utility of the same page
          (e.g., the button needs to send the data to the server).<br /><br />
          Another common theme that has come through with various sources is how
          important it is to <strong>verbalise the problem</strong>. It is
          really apparent that being able to share your problem to a person who
          has no knowledge of the problem at-hand in a way that they can
          understand what the problem is, will ulitimately assisst in the
          solution coming to mind for the problem experiences. The
          <em>Rubber Duck</em>
          method* is a great example of showing that it does not matter who you
          verbalise the problem with for it to be helpful in a solution being
          found.

            >What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped
            learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to
            your learning journey?</strong
          >
          Flipped learning students first study the topic by themselves
          (typically using video lesson on YouTube) and then apply the knowledge
          by solving problems and doing the practical work in class. This is an
          opposite or <em>flipped</em> approach to learning that has
          traditionally been done by studnets listening to lectures and take
          tests in class and read textbooks and work on problem sets at home
          (homework).<br /><br />
          Flipped learning will be an excellent model for me to learn in. I love
          the fact that this model puts the onus on me to be responsible for my
          learning journey. I am diligent enough to ensure that I will do the
          theory learning in my own time, but do believe that I learn much more
          by the actual <strong>doing of the theory</strong>. Having the time
          and support of our tutor to help wiht problems as I experience them
          <em>in action</em> will be a suitbale way of learning for me to ensure
          I am learnig tangible and productive skills to offer some real-world
          value once the course is complete.

            >What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of
            strangers?
          </strong>
          It was difficult to know where to begin, and also how much to share.
          There wasn't any limit guidance offered so it was hard for me to
          figure out the balance between sharing something that was meaningufl
          and insightful, but not too long winded. Over the years I have spent a
          fair amount of time in the discomfort of the
          <em>vulnerable zone</em> so I am not too put off these days by the
          thought, or act, of sharing my authentic story and self to others.
          <br />I find it can be helpful to share the good, the bad, and the
          ugly straight off the bat, as once I have done so I feel
          <strong
            >more freedom to roll socially without the weight of
            <em>masks, charades, or the keeping up of appearances</em> getting
            in the way</strong
          >
          of authentic expression.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? </strong>
          Yes, I do feel that I could feel my ego as I was wrtiting my
          introduction. Even though I have done much work and feel that I can
          lean into vulnerability, I still have an underlying need to be liked
          by my peers. I have recently explored where this need to be liked
          comes from, and for me it largely stems from when I was a young boy
          around the ages of eighit to ten. Looking back at that time I (rightly
          or wrongly) hold a judgment that even though my father loved me, he
          didn't <em>like</em> me. Well not as much he <em>liked</em> my two
          younger brothers anyhow. Since feeling in to this experience (or
          projection) of the past I have spent time meditating and checking in,
          with visualisation, to young Jacob where I tell him that he *is* liked
          and loved and that he <em>is</em> perfect just the way he is. I feel
          this process has helped me to remove some pent up sadness from my
          being and I am feelin more self-love in the here and now because of
          it.
