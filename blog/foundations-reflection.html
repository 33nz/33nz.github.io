      <h3>Three Learnings About Myself and Ego:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Negative Self-Talk: </strong>I realised I fall into negative
          self-talk when things get difficult. I push forward, but it's filled
          with anxiety and self-doubt.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Self-Compassion: </strong>I need to be more comfortable with
          feeling lost or unsure. I'm too hard on myself. Showing myself empathy
          throughout the learning process is crucial.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ego Comparisons: </strong>My ego quickly compares me to
          others, fueling negative self-talk. Even with no coding experience, I
          found myself comparing myself to others' perceived skill sets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h3>The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness:</h3>

      <p>
        These are key ingredients for successful learning and programming,
        especially self-empathy. I need to be kinder to myself as I learn new
        and difficult concepts. It's hard to be kind to others if you're not
        kind to yourself first. My ability to empathise relies on self-awareness
        â€“ understanding my self-talk (and adjusting it) and recognising how
        others feel to better support them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        My values of curiosity and a love of learning are essential for
        programmer development. This field requires constant learning, so
        inquisitiveness is vital.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h3>What Surprised You Most About Core Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset were most surprising.
        Understanding that my brain can change and develop new skills is crucial
        for learning programming at my age. The growth mindset concept was also
        valuable. Embracing challenges, focusing on effort, and being resilient
        are all important. I believe I naturally operate within this framework,
        but adding self-compassion and empathy is key.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Most Challenging Aspects of Core Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        While I'm generally comfortable with vulnerability, realising how
        quickly I resort to negative self-talk was confronting.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h3>Why the Focus on Core Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Learning to program is difficult. Without a solid foundation in
        self-awareness and understanding the learning process, we're more
        susceptible to failure. I believe employers often prioritise finding the
        "right fit" for their team, with technical skills being secondary
        (especially for junior positions). They'd likely value the right person
        over someone with just programming skills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h3>Was Core Learning a Waste of Time?</h3>
      <p>
        No, it has provided me with valuable insights to help me cope with the
        ups and downs of learning. While core learning is valuable, spending 30%
        of the time on it (based on my Toggle stats) might be a bit much for
        beginners. A 10% ratio might be more suitable, but I understand it's
        difficult to find a perfect balance for students with such diverse
        backgrounds.
