      <h2>Lines of Code, Layers of Conscientiousness</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hey everyone, I'm diving into the world of Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
        as part of my journey at Dev Academy. Since starting the course, I've
        been on a roll with a daily journaling habit â€“ putting pen to paper
        every morning and every evening and answering the questions on what my
        goals are, have I achieved them, and what I have learnt for the day.
        It's been a powerful tool for self-reflection.
        <br /><br />
        I also roll a 5 am "Miracle Morning" routine - something I have been
        doing for about 3 years now. It involves meditation, exercise, diving
        into a topic that sparks my curiosity (cryptocurrency lately!), and of
        course, journaling. This practice generally sets the tone for a focused
        and mindful day for me.
        <br /><br />
        There's more to my EQ development than solo activities. I also attend a
        men's group called AoteaBROa - something which I've founded with a good
        friend and is based loosely of the
        <a

          >Mankind Project</a

        teachings (another intitiative that I have attended to help my
        inner-bits). We meet on Discord every fortnight where, we delve deep
        into our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. We unpack
        challenging emotions like shame, anger, sadness, and fear, exploring how
        these feelings manifest and connect to experiences from our past,
        particularly those from our younger selves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why EQ matters</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that self-knowledge and self-awareness is a game-changer,
        impacting how you connect with yourself and others. I love how the Dev
        Academy curriculum emphasises this through building key EQ skills, which
        benefits both your learning and future employability.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>EQ vs IQ: What's the Difference?</h3>
      <p>
        IQ measures your cognitive abilities, like problem-solving and logic.
        EQ, on the other hand, focuses on your emotional intelligence. It's
        about understanding your own emotions and those of others, and using
        that knowledge to navigate situations effectively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Power of EQ</h3>
      <p>Here's why EQ is so important:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stellar Performance:</strong> Studies show that EQ is twice as
          important as IQ in the workplace, especially for leadership roles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outstanding Leadership:</strong> Emotional intelligence skills
          are crucial for effective leadership, allowing you to connect with and
          motivate your team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Happiness:</strong> EQ can contribute to a state of optimal
          well-being, where you feel clear, capable, and grounded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Building Your EQ Muscle</h3>
      <p>
        The good news is that EQ is a skillset you can develop, just like any
        other. Here are some practices to get you started:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> This involves focusing on the present
          moment without judgment. It helps you become aware of your thoughts
          and emotions, allowing you to respond rather than react.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listening:</strong> Truly pay attention to what someone is
          saying, without interrupting or formulating your response. This
          fosters deeper connection and better understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journaling:</strong> Regular journaling allows you to dump
          your thoughts and feelings onto paper. Over time, you'll gain valuable
          insights into your emotional landscape.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>'Holistic Jake' at Dev Academy Marches On</h3>
      <p>
        As I progress through Dev Academy, I'm excited to keep building my EQ
        alongside my coding skills, and I am grateful to have this balance. I
        know this well-rounded approach will not only make me a better developer
        but also a more mindful and effective communicator in all areas of life.
        I'm looking forward to continue this journey, both in coding, and
        <em>conscientiousness</em> with you all!
