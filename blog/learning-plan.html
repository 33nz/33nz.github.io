        Ultimately, I would like to be somewhat independent. I would either like
        to be working as a consultant or within my own business. More
        specifically, the fields of software development I feel I would like to
        get to working in closely would be with email (DNS), and/or being able
        to build tools that can connect into AI. <br /><br />
        Limitations to my learning would see me getting into a bit of a tiz when
        I don’t understand things. I can get lost in my own world of frustration
        and self-doubt and it is important for me to be conscious when I am
        entering this zone to decompress accordingly. Another limitation would
        me going slow, taking too much time to understand everything
        holistically, and getting behind on where I should be which can add to
        my levels of frustration and “tizzyness”.
        <br /><br />
        My capacity to operate with compassion when working in a team. I believe
        I am quick to judge and can easily hold others to the same degrees of
        standard and expectation that I impress onto myself. I need to do better
        at remembering that we are all different, so we will all work
        differently and have different degrees of standards. A big part of my
        development would be around developing skills of congeniality when it
        comes to experiencing the different communication styles that we all
        have. I am quick to judge if people don’t reply to emails in the same
        (prompt) manner I do, and get frustrated if I experience avoidance in
        confrontational discussions because I am generally comfortable to work
        through confrontation openly and constructively.
        <br /><br />
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        I commit to work with diligence and focus throughout the course. I will
        treat this (in the least) like a job with the hours I put in and will be
        working from 8am to 5pm each weekday. I will also be available to put in
        extra work over weekends and after 8pm in the evenings as required. 5pm
        - 8pm will not be available to work as this will be my designated family
        time every day. When things are starting to build up and get to me, I
        will take a break. I will decompress by removing myself from the
        computer and take 15 minutes to either meditate, play guitar, hang-out
        with my son, or just get outside. If workload is building up and I am
        struggling to keep up, and/or am getting close to a position where I may
        be putting my team in jeopardy with my completion of work - I will let
        them know before the fact, and reach out to our Dev Academy tutor to be
        transparent with them also.

        I would expect timely and “supportive” support. By this I mean that it
        is reaffirmed that it is Ok and no-problem to be asking for help with
        things. I would also expect them to be transparent on their boundaries
        with support (i.e., when they would be unavailable, and to be clear if
        they feel the support being asked for is steps too far and the answers
        to that particular problem are best to be worked with more self-directed
        focus on the path forward.
        <br /><br />
        5pm - 8pm everyday will be blocked off for the family. Also, every
        second Monday evening is completely unavailable as I help facilitate a
        men’s self-improvement group called AoteaBROa.
