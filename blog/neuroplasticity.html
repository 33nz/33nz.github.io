        Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset: Brain Powers for the Coding Journey
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is essentially our brain's built-in potential for change
        and adaptation. It underpins our ability to learn, grow, and recover
        throughout life. Neuroplasticity offers a range of benefits throughout
        life. Here are some key ways it helps us:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learning and memory</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Recovery from injury
          </li>
          <li>
            Mental health
          </li>
          <li>Overall brain fitness and congnition</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It was amazing to me to learn how neuroplasticity can help the brain recover after a stroke or brain injury by rerouting functions, meaning that undamaged areas of the brain can take over tasks handled by the injured parts, to help promote recovery.</p>
        <p>Neuroplasticy will help equip my brain with the flexibility and adaptability needed to grasp new concepts, overcome challenges, and become a confident programmer. It can do this by: </p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>Bulding new neural pathways</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhancing my problem-solving
          </li>
          <li>
            Boosting my memory
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I intend to increase the availability of my neuroplasticity (both throughout Dev Academy and into the future) by challenging myself, embracing lifelong-learning, exercising regularly, and making sure I get enough sleep. 
        </p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@john.bauer/neuroplasticity-and-programming-d7f5800278d9">This blog-post</a> was particularly helpful to me given its sharing specifically about neuroplasticity and its relevance to programming.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>A growth mindset is the belief that your intelligence and abilities are not fixed, but can develop and improve through effort and learning. It's the opposite of a fixed mindset, which views intelligence as something you're born with and can't change.
        </p>
        
        <p>Growth mindset is a powerful tool that empowers us to embrace the challenge of learning something new, focus on the effort you put in, and celebrate the journey of it all. Here's how I will use a growth mindset as a “middle-aged man” diving into computer programming:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Embracing the challenges</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Focusing on effort (not dwelling on level of talent)
          </li>
          <li>
            Embodying Lifelong Learning 
          </li>
          <li>
           Being resilient 
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.makemusic.com/blog/how-a-growth-mindset-can-transform-your-practice/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20focus%20on%20the%20idea,steps%20toward%20your%20musical%20goals.">This article</a> resonated with me as it has relevance to my programming journey and also for the learning of the guitar that I have been doing for a couple of years now.

        <h3>My learning plan with <em>Mindset</em></h3>

      <p>The commitments in <a target="_blank" href="/blog/learning-plan.html"><em>my learning plan</em></a> to both focused work and compassionate collaboration aligns with the concepts of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset.  
        <br><br>
        Consistent effort during work hours (and beyond as needed) will strengthen my neural pathways that are crucial to become a proficient developer.  Further still, my commitment to daily journaling will asssit my neuroplasticity.<br>
        A growth mindset will empower me  to view the challenges as opportunities and by embracing them with compassion, I will be able to move forward in a state of self- acceptance.
        <br><br>
        My commitment to adapt to different communication styles, and foster a compassionate and supportive learning environment where everyone feels comfortable to learn from each other's strengths can be encouraged through neuroplasticity and a growth mindset as well.
