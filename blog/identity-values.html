      <h2>A Lion Sleeps Within - Learning, Growth, and Spirit
      </h2>
      <p>
        My cultural background is hard-working and middle-class.  An upbringing that instilled a strong work ethic and a drive for success. Witnessing my parents navigate challenges as blue collar workers has shaped my resilience and tenacity. The mentorship I have done through the Project K organisation has reinforced the importance of empathy and empowering others. AoteaBROa, the online community I founded, reflects my desire to connect and foster learning. These experiences intertwined with my spiritual exploration, weaving a tapestry of core values: integrity, growth, and community.  As the saying goes, "A lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man," and this drive to connect, empower, and build something meaningful is the lion stirring within me.
<br><br>
The Dope 4 Birds test revealed my prominent "Eagle" nature - high assertiveness fueled by a love of challenge. It can, however, manifest as bluntness. My Big Five Inventory confirms this, highlighting my high Open-Mindedness but lower Agreeableness. While I value diverse perspectives, my directness can sometimes create friction.  Balancing this assertive lion within with compassion is an ongoing practice.
<br><br>
My top strengths, curiosity and a love of learning, are a perfect match for my spiritual yearning. They fuel my quest for knowledge and understanding, both external and internal. However, limitations exist. Humility and Self-Regulation, areas marked for improvement, can hinder my ability to learn from mistakes and collaborate effectively.
<br><br>
One instance where collaboration proved challenging involved a clash with a coworker in my Hemp food business start-up. My assertive nature clashed with their creative process. While I tried clear communication, frustration mounted. Looking back, I could have embodied the spirit of Paramahansa Yogananda's quote, "Change yourself and you have done your part in changing the world." By practicing active listening (a facet of Humility) and adopting a gentler approach, I could have fostered a more collaborative environment. Perhaps humor, another strength, could have been used to build rapport and encourage open dialogue.  Taming the lion's roar with a dash of humility and humor could have led to a more successful outcome.
<br><br>
These experiences paint a portrait of a work in progress, a soul constantly learning and evolving. My journey will be filled with challenges, but by embracing my strengths, acknowledging my limitations, and fostering a growth mindset, I can navigate the maze of learning and emerge a better version of myself.  The spiritual dimension adds a powerful layer to this growth. By quieting the ego and cultivating compassion, I can truly connect and collaborate with others.  This journey is not just about external achievements, but also about inner transformation, about the lion within learning to roar in harmony with the world around it.
<br><br>
This blog post is just a glimpse into my experiences and thought processes. Feel free to leave comments or questions below â€“  I'm always eager to connect and learn from others on this shared path of growth!
